  Fire and Steel is a list of projects on scratch and imitates Hearts of Iron 4, a Pardox interacive grand strategy game. You take charge of any country during 1936 and navigate through the Second World War. Each nation has its own military and industry and the aim of the game is to bring your nation to victory.
  
  The diffrent mods - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/739942072/ The 1st project of Fire and Steel is "Fire and steel - v.1.5 (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)" and only contains the European map and 29 nations to choose from, with it's starting date being 1st, Jan, 1936. Mods can range from simply adding changing the borders of nation or creating a whole new map, flags and nations. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/961715615/ "Fire and steel -MLP FiM 2.0 [.] (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)" is a mod that is based on the Geo-politics of the show; My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It contains 40 unique and fictional nations, a new map with 4 continents, and unique divisons. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719922922/ "Fire and steel - WW1! (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)" is another mod, while using the same European map as "Fire and steel - v.1.5 (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)", it takes places in 1910, 4 years before the Great War.

Mechanics:

  Diplomacy - Whilst playing as a nation, interaction with other AI nations is crucial. For every in-game day that passes, you'll gain a number of poltical power (based on the difficulty you have set your game to). And every single diplomatic action you do requires poltical power.
  
  Military - The miltary is essential for gameplay if ones want to expand and/or defend their land. To capture land, you must be at war with a nation and have at least one divison in an enemy provice or have your divisons destroy the enemy divisons within said province to capture it.
  
  Industry - You require equipment to create new divison and equipment can only obtain by creating in factories. The more factories, the more equipment. And to get more factories, you must build them or capture an enemy provinces with factories.
  
  Manpower - You also require manpower to create divisons. For every in-game day, you'll get a number of manpower. To get more manpower, you could wait or capture enemy provinces and wait for a shorter period of time. Therefore, more provinces=more manpower.
  
  How to play; to see, go to the instructions of a Fire and Steel project.


  Upcoming projects - "Fire and steel -All Provinces Indepentent World". It's a mod for the world map and is where every single province will be its own nation. It'll contain 300+ nations and will be released whenever I can stop being lazy and finish random side question I get myself into ðŸ˜…. Focus Trees is something I also would like to create more of...but I'm to lazy...

Notes: The 1st project of Fire and Steel was made by Vast_Gamer and "Fire and steel - v.1.5 (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)" isn't actual the orginally or even a perfect copy as "Fire and steel - v.1.5 (hearts of iron 4/HOI4 in scratch)" includes Luxembourg, which the orginally project didn't include. The original project was taken down by scratch, I'm sure I do have a perfect copy somewhere in my projects...but there's also alota other trash ðŸ˜….

Also, please follow, like and heart the projects. Please? ðŸ¥º. And if you'll ever need me, send me a message over svcartch...I'll check my messages probably...
